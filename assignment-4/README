# Emscripten

  Used for Compiling c++ to web

## Code Changes (for web-ability)

  In order for the browser to still have access to its main loop, we need to use a wrapper function
  from emscripten. For example:

  ```cpp
  #ifdef EMSCRIPTEN
    emscripten_set_main_loop(render_func, 60, 1);
  #else
    while(true) {
      render_func();
    }
  #endif
  ```

  To cancel emscripten's main loop, 

  ```cpp
  #ifdef EMSCRIPTEN
    emscripten_cancel_main_loop();
  #endif
  ```

## Compiling

  These are useful flags for SDL specific:
    * -s USE_SDL=2
    * -s USE_SDL_IMAGE=2
    * -s USE_SDL_TTF=2

To include assets, 

  ```sh
  emcc --preload-file=<dir> ...
  ```

## Warning

  On compillation, our program would throw "-Wnon-virtual-dtor" warning from -Weffc++, but is manually supressed.
  In researching this warning (citation in References), we found a quote from a G++ developer

  "enable_shared_from_this doesn't have virtual functions, but GCC will warn if 
  the derived class has virtual functions not only if the base class does. -Weffc++
  has lots of known flaws, including the fact the Item numbers refer to old editions 
  of the books, some of those Items were removed or rewritten for later editions and
    the warning hasn't been updated, and in some cases it warns about style not 
    correctness, it's not always useful. The -Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor option 
    (which originated with Clang and I added to G++) is more useful than -Wnon-virtual-dtor"

  Another quote says 

  Don't use -Weffc++ all the time. It's useful to turn it on sometimes to check your code, 
  but not really to use it permanently. It gives false positives and *is not really maintained these days.*
